# JS-Symbolic-Algebra

This repository contains three functions: *cartowpow*, *simplify*, and *derive*. *cartowpow* converts all carets to *pow()* functions; *simplify* reduces mathematical expressions to simpler forms; and *derive* takes the derivative of a mathematical expression. Note that these scripts are incomplete (see *To Do* for some examples of this) and I have not been actively developing them for several years.
